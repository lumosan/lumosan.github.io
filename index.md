I recently received an M.Sc. in Communication Systems from the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). Before that, I earned a B.Sc. in Telematics Engineering at [Comillas Pontifical University](https://www.comillas.edu/en/), in Madrid.

### Experience

#### 2019 · Schindler
During my last semester of studies I completed an internship at Schindler. I designed and implemented a pipeline that classifies patent documents based on the elevator systems and components. I was given the opportunity to work with a patent attorney and a product engineer. Working with experts in these fields was a very enriching experience, allowing me to learn about the documents and products I was dealing with, as well as to make sensible decisions regarding the design of the pipeline and evaluate the final results. I submitted this work as my M.Sc. thesis.

#### 2018 · Dathena
While completing my M.Sc. studies I also worked as a data science intern at [Dathena](https://www.dathena.io/), a data security company based in Singapore. At the time of my internship the company still had not exceeded 50 staff, making it possible to learn about some of the tasks carried out at each department. During my time at the company I contributed to the data protection pipeline as well as to an optical character recognition project.

#### 2016 · Transp-OR Laboratory (EPFL)
Before that, I completed my B.Sc. thesis as a research assistant in the [Transport and Mobility Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/transp-or/) at EPFL. I worked on the statistical analysis of passenger satisfaction in railway networks, with the aim of identifying the factors with the greatest impact on passenger satisfaction. After this experience I became especially interested in data science and
analytics implementations and decided to pursue a Masters degree at EPFL.


<!-- ### Education

I received a B.Sc. in  The degree covered many topics at the intersection of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, including signal processing, software engineering and computer networks.



I have taken the courses in Data Analysis and Machine Learning, both of which have a strong focus on practical assign-
ments and have allowed me to gain experience with Python and its main machine learning libraries. For one of the
final projects my team and I implemented all the fundamental steps of the data science pipeline in order to quantify
the impact that a certain event had on the Twitter community. I have also gained experience in Deep Learning with
the PyTorch and Tensorflow frameworks and I am familiar with the Information Retrieval, Data Mining and Natural
Language Processing concepts and algorithms. -->

### Education

#### 2019 · M.Sc. in Communication Systems, spec. in Data Analytics (EPFL)

- _Semester Project_ – Analysis of student behavior during collaborative synchronous writing to automatically determine role taking and writting patterns. Design of the features used to describe authors’ editing patterns.

- _Machine Learning_ – Analysis and implementation of fundamental techniques in ML using Python. The final project for this course consisted in the implementation of a recommender system for movies based on user ratings, for which we used an ensembled approach ([see on GitHub](https://github.com/lumosan/deeplearning2018/tree/master/Projects/Project1)).

- _Deep Learning_ – Mathematical basis and use of deep learning methods on applied problems with PyTorch. For this course we trained a model based on LSTM and CNN to predict finger movements from electroencephalograms ([see on GitHub](https://github.com/lumosan/ml2017-projects/tree/master/project2/project_recommender_system)).

- _Applied Data Analysis_ – Development of data science pipelines with emphasis in practical skills using Python and several libraries for data science, including: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit Learn, Spacy, NLTK, BeautifulSoup and requests.
